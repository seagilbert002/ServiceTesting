How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality, I rely on unit testing, as demonstrated in my approach to the Contact, Appointment, and Task classes. I use requirements as a foundation for creating tests, such as verifying the length and null status of data fields. Testing edje cases is crucial to ensuring robustness, so I create deliberately incorrect instances to test my code's integrity.
To address security, I focus on rigorously validating inputs. For example handling null values or over long inputs ensures the program won't fail or produce unintended behavior due to improperuser inputs. Furthermore, adhering to secure coding practices like encapsulating data with getter and setter methods and isolating functionality within classes ensures that components are maintainable and less prone to vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are primarily interpreted through the requirements provided. For instance, when designing the Contact class, the requirement for a number field was exactly 10 characters guided both my implementation and the test cases. This ensures that the program behaves in a way that meets user expectations. To go beyond explicit requirements, I consider edge cases and scenarios that users might encounter but haven't been documented. For example, addressing how the program should handle empty or null values ensures a seamless user experience. By thinking about these potential outcomes, I design programs that are comprehensive and user focused.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design with the mindset of modularity and efficiency. I focus on creating reusable components by identifying commonalities between objects, as seen in how similar methods for Contact, Appointment, and Task were adapted and reused. This saves development time and ensures consistency across the program. The process starts with a thorough understanding of the requirements, followed by defining clear responsibilities for each component. Using accessor methods in my constructors, I ensure that the code adheres to the principles of encapsulation, making it easier to maintain and extend. Finally, I prioritize testing throughout the design process, ensuring that the software is both functional and reliable before moving on to integration testing.
